# EMPLOYEE CHURN MODEL


In the realm of modern organizations, the retention of valuable employees is a 
paramount concern. Employee churn, which refers to employees leaving their positions 
voluntarily, can lead to disruptions and challenges for businesses. The objective of this 
project is to develop an Employee Churn Model that can accurately predict whether an 
employee is likely to leave and assign them to appropriate risk categories based on their 
churn probability.

## Dataset

In this case study, a HR dataset was sourced from [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & 
Performance](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/home) which contains employee data for 
1,470 employees with various information about the employee.
